An old project I found on my laptop (uni year 1), attempting to parse and write VSQx files from Racket/Scheme - for funsies.

### What does it do?
Honestly, I have no idea anymore. I believe it applies some general notebending the way I used to do it manually, and it has a (nice) GUI.

### What can I do with it?
Take a look at the code, use it for your own projects, write your own VSQx parser in Scheme... the possibilities are truly endless!
